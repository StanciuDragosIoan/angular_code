/*
    directives are instructions in the DOM

        components can be considered directives - directives with a template
        (when placing component selectors in the DOM we instruct angular to palce component there)


        e.g directive without a template:
        <p appturnGreen>Receives a green background</p>

        usually we add directives with an attribute selector (but we can
        also configure the directive's selector - like css classes)
