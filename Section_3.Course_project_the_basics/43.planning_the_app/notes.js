/*
    first we'll plan the app structure (think about which components will be required)

    the app will have 2 features:
        a shopping list
        a recipe book
        ]

    ## COMPONENTS:

    we'll have a root component which will hold:
        header component (used for routing later)

        shopping list component
        shopping list edit component (nested in the shopping list component)


        recipe list component
            recipe item (each nested in the recipe list)
            recipe detail area


    ## Models

    ingredient model (in the shopping list and for recipes too)

    recipe model
