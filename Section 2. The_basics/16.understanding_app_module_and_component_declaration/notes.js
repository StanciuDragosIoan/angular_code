/*
    app.module.ts bundles the functionality of our app (as we are only using
    the app.module.ts for this project)

    it bootstraps the project (see the 'bootstrap' array passed to the decorator)
        in 'bootstrap' we only have AppComponent (as that's the component angular needs
        to bootstrap the project/to start it up)

    registered the ServerComponent in the app.module.ts file
        added the ServerComponent to the declarations array;
        imported ServerComponent at the top;
