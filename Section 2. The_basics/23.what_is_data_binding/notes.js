    ONE WAY DATA BINDING:


   ###  data binding = communication between the .ts file of component (business logic)


    and the template (what the user sees)

        we can output data from the .ts file in the html template
            we can use

                string interpolation:

                    {{data}}

                    or


                property binding:
                    [property]=data

     ### event binding (react to user events and send 'data' from the template
     to the typescript code (buisiness logic)

            (event) = "expression"


        TWO WAY DATA BINDING

     it means doing both (react to user events in the template and at the same
     time output something from the .ts file)
