/*
    declared 2 properties in the server component
    output them on the screen through string interpolation

        we can use numbers with string interpolation (they are converted to a string)

    defined a method in the server component:

          getServerStatus() {
                return this.serverStatus;
            }

    called it in the template

        {{ getServerStatus() }}
